Notes
* Has an accountant that does end-of year
* Boyfriend is a contractor and has been using FreeAgent for around 6 years
* When starting up, looked for an easy way to do invoicing, estimates, expenses
* Started business 2011
* She booked a call with one of the support team to help get her set up
* Stories


Carla got fed up of using her accountants home-brew system (Pandol). It didn’t help her invoice (She uses 3rd party invoicing software that’s integrated with a CRM instead), and she found it hard to get an overview of her business money. She tried FreeAgent, but found that it still left her with a lot of work to do because she still had to feed data into Pandol.


Timeline


Timeline
	First Thought
	Day 1
	Found it more time consuming to explain bank transactions
	Passive
		Looked up the KB to see if there was a better way of doing it. Went about using both FreeAgent and Pandol.
	Event 1
	Day 17
	Remembered an email from her accountant telling them about a new version of Pandol.
	Active
	

	Asked her accountant about the improvements, these included an aesthetic overhaul and improvements to the customer dashboard (i.e. she would be able to see finance status info a bit better)
	Event 2
	Day 25
	Really enjoying FreeAgent, but found out that her accountant wouldn’t budge on software.
	Deciding
	

	Didn’t consider any other options as her accountant said there was no room for negotiation regarding software
	Purchased
	Day 30
	Stayed with Pandol and 3rd party Invoicing solution
	Consuming
	

	Not very happy with it, prefers FreeAgent by far. If there was a way to get info out of FA and into Pandol, no brainer. 
	Forces of Progress


Push of the situation > 
	Magnetism of the new solution > 
	* Invoicing is a pain
* Doesn't have any insight into her business finances


	* Loves FreeAgent – so easy to understand
* Overview and tax timeline really helped her get an understanding of her finances
* Boyfriend uses it and recommends it
	< Habit of the present
	< Anxiety of the new solution
	* Accountant has their own solution and won’t change 
	* Bank reconciliation was more time consuming than in Pandol
* She needed to export her accounts to give to her accountant
