Notes
* Romanian photographer who lives in London. Started photography has a hobby, started in  professional capacity 2-3 years ago. 
* Straight away struggled with business admin, invoices etc…
* Started using Wave 2 years ago, felt it didn’t cater for UK businesses adequately
* August 2015 : Found out about FreeAgent via YouTube – he’s a self learner
* Dec 2015: Looked at FreeAgent then, but didn’t subscribe because “I didn’t subscribe straight away you guys were charging a lot of money – I think around £19 per month”
* Assumed that “You guys were advising this programme and an accountant. I thought “Jesus”[a].
* “I also have a subscription for Linda, Adobe, paying for my equipment (I’m paying this off slowly-slowly), I don’t know if I can manage to afford this as well”[b]
* “Looked up people what they’re saying – they say it’s good”
* “You guys had an offer on in November/December I think, for a free month”[c]
* “I’ll trial FreeAgent to see if it’s easier to use than WAVE”[d]
* FreeAgent offered “more features” compared to WAVE
* “I liked it” – “I thought I try it for a month, then thinking if I should join for a while, see how things are working, then take a break, then join at the end of the year when I need to do my taxes again” – ”It’s because of the money, I think it’s not that much, because you offer a lot, but for me right now, I’m paying for a lot of stuff, stuff I really need, like Adobe for editing photos, £50 I think, insurance for my equipment.”
* “I’m working with WAVE and working with Google spreadsheets – going back and forth between them, calculating my own things –  if I were to do through you guys, it’d be much easier. Kinda in a way it’d be worth the money, but I’m still thinking…”[e]
* WAVE – puts all the money from the business in, invoices,expenses
* Google Spreadsheets – ”I do the totals in here, with my personal expenses to see where I am with money”[f]
* “WAVE has also an integrated budgeting (Work and personal) but not used yet”
* Tried a few pieces of accounting software – he wanted to have software on this phone. “A laptop, you have to put in a password and type – It’s a bit more comfortable to use the phone”
* WAVE has a mobile app, it’s easy to use and very fast, same as you guys do – ”I’m just more familiar with it because I’ve been using it for a while”
* “WAVE also has an application called Receipt which, you just take pictures of your receipts and it automatically categorises them in your expenses.”
* Why he started looking for an alternative solution : WAVE – all their training and tutorials were very US focused.
* His friend has done his self-assessment in previous years
* Found doing his tax return scary – advice he was given – “be careful, do it slowly, because if you get it wrong, it’s very serious” – first time I did it was the 2 days before tax return was due, I left it until the “I was really really scared”
* Still needs help from software “putting everything in categories”
* When he has more money, he’ll hire someone to do his returns
* Describing his decision process for choosing whether or not to subscribe to FreeAgent : “I can pay this money, I can unsubscribe from Netflix, make the money to cover this £19” – “At the time though, I thought, no I can learn this, I want to learn as much as I can. If I’m simplifying my work just now, chances are that I won’t be bothered to learn, and I’ll end up hiring an accountant as well, and end up spending more money. Sometimes the accountants help you a lot, sometimes not. Some charge £200 for an end of year service. Some are really bad, my friend nearly got arrested as a result of an accountant doing something very very bad with his accounts.”[g]
* Perhaps As a result of this experience, he “felt more comfortable to learn myself, I have my Wave account and it’s free”
* “I thought FreeAgent were younger 9 years, and this is why they’re charging so much money. Maybe when they have a few more customers, they’ll charge less”
* Uses app store pricing as an analogy for the options he’s presented with. An app from the app store might be 69p, one £1.00. But you’d think twice about paying for the £1.00 one, but in the end, it’s only £1.00. Why are you charging £1.00?[h]
* When working out how much he thinks would be fair to pay for FreeAgent he thinks about the other services he pays for, Linda (£8-£10) and has extra features for extra money. Wonders if FreeAgent has such a structure? He started out with Adobe with and £8 subscription, then increased it slowly as he started to use more applications. “Once I payed a little bit, and saw how it worked”
* FA : “The free month is good, but it I’m just getting used to it, and I don’t get to enjoy it so much as I’ve just learned how to use it. When you first start to observe the benefits[i] of having it, that’s when you need a few more months at a price for a beginner company, or offering some kind of tutorials on how to choose your accountan[j]t”
* An all inclusive, get an accountant to check your accounts at the end of the year “Would be great”
* Was looking for information about tax reduction on YouTube when he discovered FreeAgent.
* When he started using WAVE, he didn’t trust them.
* He enjoyed seeing the faces of FreeAgent, the warmth. This made him trust us.[k]
* “If I find something in the UK, I might use that”[l]
* Slowly lost interest in FreeAgent after using it a few times. He lost interest because “Having to learn a new software, and having to deal with the pressure from end of year. I had to focus on one of them.”[m]. Draws an analogy with his new camera. He falls back on what he knows, something familiar, when he’s under pressure.
* Went back to FreeAgent when he received an email, “Ok, I’ll give it another try, I’m too late, I’ll try later, but then in the the thing expired, I was feeling like I just want to try it, put all my invoices in , all my data in there, to see how it looks, and how it calculates all my expenses.”[n], “Wave at the start was hard to get but now that I’ve been using it for a few years I’m familiar with it and I was curios to see if FreeAgent was offering an easier way – but I never got to see that in the end, because I didn’t get to do more than a month”
* He talks about how he likes everything neat and tidy, in order. If he started with FreeAgent he’d like to do everything properly, but this would take a lot of time, at a time that was very busy for him.
* “ I was so disorganised at the start of my business, photos everywhere, It’s so much easier to have everything organised[o]”
* When asked about FreeAgent hypothetically being restricted by volume e.g. only allowed to send 10 invoices per month – wasn’t fussed as it would feel stressful. “Some months, I send a lot of invoices. I’d get stressed by reaching the limit”. Maybe if support was limited. Or I could pay more for times when I really need it.
Story


Timeline


Timeline
	First Thought
	Sometime 2014
	Wave Accounting didn’t deal with UK tax - Tax is a major pain point for him
	Passive
	Aug 2015
	Searched for information about tax reduction on YouTube, he wanted to learn for himself. 
	Event 1
	30 Dec 2015
	Found a video from FreeAgent. Looked at the FreeAgent marketing site.
	Active
	

	Trialed FreeAgent, and looked at the marketing sites of alternatives.
	Event 2
	10(ish) Jan 2016
	Tax Return was due soon
	Deciding
	

	He wanted to “see all his data in there”, but didn’t have time to do so. He went back to what he knew because of time constraints. “Having to learn a new software, and having to deal with the pressure from end of year. I had to focus on one of them.”
	Purchase
	29 Jan 2016
	Didn’t subscribe to anything
	Consuming
	

	He’s still in the same place, but feels that he wants to learn this stuff for himself. Subscribing to FreeAgent at this point may stop him from making the effort to learn and improve.
	Satisfaction
	

	

	

Forces of Progress


Push of the situation > 
	Magnetism of the new solution > 
	* Wave doesn’t suit UK businesses well
	* Helps him get organised
* Trusted FreeAgent, the faces on the website helped
* Offer of a free trial month
* More features than Wave


	< Habit of the present
	< Anxiety of the new solution
	* Wave and Google works well for him and he’s used to using them, even though he knows they’re not ideal
* He’s on a learning path 


	* Can’t afford it right now, I’m 
* Didn’t manage to observe the benefits during his 30 day trial
* Using FreeAgent meant that he would stop improving his accounting knowledge
* Thought that FreeAgent were advising that you need an accountant as well as the software




	

[a]The assumption that we were advising that customers should use an accountant – this was clarified later in the interview. At the end of the video tutorials, we advise them to get an accountant to check the figures over.
[b]His consideration set includes non- accounting software (software that's essential to his work, software for learning) and equipment.
[c]Pressumed this was an offer
[d]Was looking to simply self assessment
[e]Worth the money, but still thinking…
[f]Uses Sheets to calculate overview figures and budget
[g]Weighing up cost with stuff he's already paying for. Pretty common. But, saw FreeAgent as something that would stop him learning stuff which means he'd have to hire an accountant anyway, and he doesn't seem enamoured with hiring an accountant. He's heard bad things about his friends accountant.
[h]Price isn't about value – it's about how it compares to something else. Has it got more to do with anchoring than value?
[i]Generally, you don't observe the benefits of using FreeAgent until you're using it in anger, maybe a few months in. How might we help people use FreeAgent at a lower cost for the first few months or even full financial year?
[j]Choosing an accountant he can trust is a big deal. How might we help him do this?
[k]Trust is one of our major USP's. We perhaps need to make more of this. We're in the UK – here are our real people. Finances are sensitive thing.
[l]UK is important. From a tax perspective, communication perspective.
[m]Hypothesis : End of year is when people are under pressure and seem to try FA out. But it's optimistic. They'll always fall back on what they know when they're under pressure. It's a bad time to contemplate change.
[n]"See how it looks" is recurring
[o]People who trial FreeAgent are often going through a process upgrade. In a organise stuff mindset. This takes time though. How do we mitigate the need for them to see setting up and getting going with FreeAgent as such a big deal.
