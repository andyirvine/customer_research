Takeaways


Post interview brain dump


* Knew he needed something/someone to handle his accounts as his business was slightly more complex
* Price of FreeAgent was wrapped up in the accountancy costs
* Client of Arcata accountancy practice http://www.arcata.co.uk/. They were recommended to him by a friend whilst on a mountain biking trip. The friend also recommended FreeAgent.
* James looked at the FreeAgent website after the conversation but didn’t look at the software. He wasn’t up and running by that point.
* He had a meeting with his accountant to see if they could work together. The accountant recommended that he use FreeAgent. He didn’t suggest an alternative, though they have Xero Certified Advisor badge on their website.
* Price of FreeAgent didn’t come into the conversation as it’s wrapped up with the accountant's fees.
* Didn’t seriously consider not using an accountant. Didn’t consider not using a piece of software to help him out. He didn’t want to get in a mess.
* Accountant demoed an account during their initial consultation. He said this was good in terms of helping him understand what the software did. It wasn’t a tipping point, maybe not a deal clincher either, but definitely helped confirm that FA was the right choice. (What would have happened if there had been no demo??)
* Being a sole trader, he trusts the opinions of his peers
* Timeline:
   * First Thought (Nov) : Had a conversation with his mate and first heard of FreeAgent during a conversation about how he ran his business. His friend mentioned however that he wasn’t sure how FreeAgent would work for a business like his. His mate uses it to run a photography business. He brought up this conversation 
   * Passive Looking (Nov) : First looked at FreeAgent after conversation with friend. Only looked at the website, didn’t sign up.
   * Early May : Had an initial meeting with an accountant – FreeAgent was part of the accountancy package. He signed up with the accountant the next day.
   * June : Subscribed to FreeAgent - set up bank accounts - “There’s not much you can do without this setup”
   * July : First used FreeAgent in anger to send an invoice.


Interview Notes


Story


I always intended to set up his own business and was studying to be a distiller. My course gave me basic business advice, which helped me understand what I needed to learn, and where to go for help. I knew my accounts might be complex, so I was always going to use an accountant.

		First heard of FreeAgent during a conversation with his friend who’s a freelance photographer in which he first heard of FreeAgent.
